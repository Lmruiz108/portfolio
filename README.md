Utilized for the workplace. Short descriptions and evidence of the projects I've designed.

iSongly - I was the main programmer in the iSongly program, which takes in a file of over 600 songs from the 2010s and allows users to filter the songs based on different criteria. This program utilizes Java and the data structure red and black trees.

Commute Time Calculator - I was the main programmer of the commute time calculator, which handles a hash table of over 150 nodes representing the locations of different locations on the UW-Madison Campus. This program allows users to find the shortest distance between two locaitons using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and also allows users to see which locations are reachable in a certain amount of time. Utilizes a hash table, a web server, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
